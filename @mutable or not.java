ðŸ”¸Immutability refers to the property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. In the context of programming,
    immutability typically applies to data types such as strings, numbers, and collections (e.g., lists, sets, maps).
ðŸ”¸In languages like Java, strings are immutable, meaning once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed.
ðŸ”¸Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object with the modified value, leaving the original string unchanged

Output:
Strings are immutable.
